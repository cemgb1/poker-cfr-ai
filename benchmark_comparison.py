# benchmark_comparison.py - Compare old vs new CFR system performance

"""
Benchmark script to demonstrate the improvements of the Simplified CFR system
over the traditional hand category-based approach.

This script runs both systems and compares:
- Coverage of hole card combinations
- Training speed (iterations per minute)  
- Scenario diversity
- Exploration effectiveness
