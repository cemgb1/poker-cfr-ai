# üÉè Poker CFR AI - Complete Strategy Training System

A professional-grade Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) implementation for poker artificial intelligence. This system trains optimal strategies for all 169 starting hands across both preflop and postflop scenarios, using advanced machine learning techniques employed by commercial poker solvers.

## üéØ What This System Does

**Trains a Complete Poker AI** that can provide optimal strategy recommendations for any poker situation:
- **Preflop**: Opening, calling, raising, and folding decisions for all 169 possible starting hands
- **Postflop**: Betting, calling, and folding strategies across different board textures and hand strengths
- **Position-Aware**: Different strategies for Button (BTN) vs Big Blind (BB) positions
- **Stack-Depth Conscious**: Adjusts recommendations based on effective stack sizes

**Example Outputs:**
- "With AK‚ô† on the Button facing a raise: **RAISE** (87% frequency)"
- "With 77 on A‚ô†8‚ô•2‚ô¶ board in Big Blind: **CALL** (65% frequency)"
- "With A‚ô†3‚ô† on 9‚ô†7‚ô†2‚ô• board: **RAISE** (flush draw + overcards)"

## üß† The Science Behind CFR

### What is Counterfactual Regret Minimization?

CFR is a game theory algorithm that learns optimal strategies by:

1. **Playing against itself** millions of times
2. **Tracking regret** for not taking better actions
3. **Minimizing regret** over time to approach Nash equilibrium
4. **Converging to optimal play** that no opponent can exploit

This is the same fundamental approach used by:
- **Libratus** (beat top human pros in 2017)
- **Pluribus** (beat 5 human pros simultaneously in 2019)
- **Commercial solvers** like PioSOLVER and GTO+

### Why CFR Works for Poker

Poker is a game of **imperfect information** - you can't see your opponent's cards. CFR excels at these scenarios because it:
- **Handles uncertainty** by considering all possible opponent holdings
- **Balances strategies** to remain unexploitable
- **Finds equilibrium** solutions that are mathematically optimal
- **Scales efficiently** to complex game trees

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### The Big Picture
```
Training (Cloud) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Export ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Local Deployment
   Heavy Compute           CSV Files      Fast Lookups
   $1-2 total cost        ~50MB total     Instant queries
   One-time training      Portable        Offline capable
```

### Strategic Hand Grouping

Instead of training 169 individual hands separately, the system uses **strategic grouping**:

- **Premium Pairs**: AA, KK, QQ (play aggressively)
- **Medium Pairs**: JJ, TT, 99 (position-dependent)  
- **Small Pairs**: 22-88 (set-mining focused)
- **Premium Aces Suited**: AKs, AQs, AJs (high aggression)
- **Suited Connectors**: T9s, 98s, 87s (drawing potential)
- **Offsuit Trash**: 72o, 83o, etc. (mostly fold)

This approach makes the problem **computationally tractable** while maintaining strategic accuracy.

### Equal Distribution Training

Traditional CFR can miss important scenarios. This system uses **forced scenario training**:

```python
# Instead of random training:
while iterations < max_iterations:
    train_random_scenario()  # Some scenarios might never be seen!

# We use targeted training:
while undertrained_scenarios_exist():
    train_least_seen_scenario()  # Guarantees comprehensive coverage
```

This ensures every possible poker situation gets adequate training time.

## üìä Scale and Complexity

### Preflop Scenarios: ~1,500 total
- 18 hand groups √ó 2 positions √ó 7 action histories √ó 3 stack depths
- Examples: "Premium pairs in Button position facing a 3-bet with deep stacks"

### Postflop Scenarios: ~485,000 total  
- 18 hand groups √ó 16 board textures √ó 17 hand interactions √ó 2 positions √ó 4 preflop histories √ó 7 postflop histories √ó 3 stack depths
- Examples: "Medium pairs on paired board with set, in Big Blind, after calling preflop raise, facing continuation bet"

### Why So Many Scenarios?

Poker strategy depends on **context**:
- **AK on A‚ô†7‚ô•2‚ô¶**: Strong (top pair, good kicker) 
- **AK on A‚ô†A‚ô•7‚ô¶**: Weaker (trips likely, kicker plays down)
- **77 on 7‚ô†8‚ô†9‚ô¶**: Very strong (set with straight/flush draws possible)
- **77 on A‚ô†K‚ô†Q‚ô¶**: Weak (low set on dangerous board)

Each context requires different optimal play, hence the massive scenario space.

## üî¨ Technical Innovation

### 1. Scenario-Based Stopping Criterion
```
Traditional: "Train for 1 million iterations"
This System: "Train until every scenario has 300+ visits"
```
**Result**: Guaranteed comprehensive coverage instead of random sampling.

### 2. Cloud-Optimized Architecture
- **Training**: Heavy computation on powerful cloud instances
- **Inference**: Lightweight CSV lookups on local machines
- **Cost-Effective**: Train once for $1-2, query forever for free

### 3. Professional Hand Evaluation
```python
# Considers multiple factors:
- Hand strength (pair, two pair, straight, etc.)
- Board texture (dry, wet, coordinated, paired)  
- Position (early, late, blinds)
- Action history (raise, call, check sequences)
- Stack depth (short, medium, deep)
- Drawing potential (flush draws, straight draws)
```
