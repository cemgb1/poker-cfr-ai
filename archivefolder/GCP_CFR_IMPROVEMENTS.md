# GCP CFR Training Improvements

This document summarizes the robust error handling and checkpointing improvements made to the GCP CFR training system to address worker crashes and enhance reliability for long-running jobs.

## Problem Statement

The original GCP CFR training script was encountering errors where workers crash with KeyError or similar exceptions related to the 'fold' action and other issues. The system needed:

1. Robust error handling and detailed exception logging
2. Validation that 'fold' and all valid actions are present and handled correctly
3. Periodic checkpointing every 15 minutes for training recovery
4. User-friendly checkpoint resumption

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling (`run_gcp_cfr_training.py`)

**Worker Process Improvements:**
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around all training operations
- Enhanced logging with full tracebacks and scenario context when errors occur
- Added scenario and result validation before processing to prevent KeyError issues
- Implemented graceful error recovery - individual iteration failures don't crash entire worker
- Added new detailed error message types: `iteration_error`, `worker_critical_error`

**Action Validation:**
- Added `_validate_scenario()` method to check all required fields and specifically validate 'fold' action exists
- Added `_validate_training_result()` method to verify result structure and known actions
- Enhanced logging to identify exactly which scenario and action caused any issues

### 2. Robust Action Safety (`enhanced_cfr_trainer_v2.py`)

**Strategy Calculation:**
- Enhanced `get_strategy()` with comprehensive validation and fallback to uniform strategy if errors occur
- Added defensive programming for all action dictionary access patterns
- Validates that 'fold' and all actions are available before processing

**Regret Updates:**
- Improved `update_enhanced_regrets()` with input validation and error handling
- Added safe strategy sum updates with validation to prevent KeyError issues
- Enhanced counterfactual payoff estimation with error handling

### 3. Periodic Checkpointing System (`run_gcp_cfr_training.py`)

**Automatic Checkpointing:**
- Created automatic `checkpoints/` directory on startup
- Implemented `save_checkpoint()` with timestamped files every 15 minutes (aligned with log interval)
- Saves comprehensive state: strategies, regrets, performance metrics, training progress
- Added checkpoint cleanup (keeps only 5 most recent to save disk space)

**Checkpoint Recovery:**
- Added `load_latest_checkpoint()` with validation and error handling
- Implemented `prompt_checkpoint_resume()` with auto-resume for recent checkpoints (<24h)
- Version compatibility checking to ensure safe restoration

### 4. Memory Monitoring and System Health

**Resource Monitoring:**
- Added memory usage monitoring using `psutil` library
- Enhanced progress logging with system memory, process memory, and CPU usage
- Warnings for high memory usage (>1GB process, >90% system memory)
- Progress reporting includes scenario coverage and training statistics

### 5. Graceful Shutdown Management

**Signal Handling:**
- Enhanced `setup_signal_handlers()` for robust GCP job management
- Handles SIGINT (Ctrl+C), SIGTERM (container termination), and SIGUSR1
- Creates emergency backups before shutdown with timestamped filenames
- Saves final checkpoint during graceful shutdown
- Proper worker process termination and cleanup

**Training Loop Integration:**
- Added shutdown request checking throughout training loop
- Proper worker process management (terminate → wait → force kill if needed)
- Emergency backup of current results stored for signal handlers

## Usage

### Starting Training
```bash
# Normal training with all improvements
python run_gcp_cfr_training.py --mode=parallel --iterations=200000

# Training will automatically:
# - Check for existing checkpoints and prompt to resume
# - Save checkpoints every 15 minutes
# - Monitor memory usage and log warnings
# - Handle worker errors gracefully
# - Create emergency backups on shutdown
```

### Checkpoint Management
- Checkpoints are automatically saved to `checkpoints/` directory
- Recent checkpoints (<24h) are auto-resumed for continuous training
- Manual checkpoint loading available via `load_latest_checkpoint()`
- Checkpoint cleanup keeps only 5 most recent files

### Error Handling
- Workers continue training even if individual iterations fail
- Detailed error logs include scenario context and full tracebacks
- Action validation prevents KeyError issues with 'fold' and other actions
- Graceful degradation with fallback strategies when errors occur

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `run_gcp_cfr_training.py`: Main training script with checkpointing and error handling
- `enhanced_cfr_trainer_v2.py`: CFR trainer with defensive programming and validation

### Dependencies Added
- `psutil`: For memory and system monitoring

### New Error Types
- `iteration_error`: Individual training iteration failures with context
- `worker_critical_error`: Critical worker failures requiring attention

### Checkpoint Data Structure
```python
checkpoint_data = {
    'timestamp': '20241208_155845',
    'elapsed_time': 1800.0,  # seconds
    'combined_regret_sum': {...},
    'combined_strategy_sum': {...},
    'performance_metrics': [...],
    'version': '1.0'
}
```

## Benefits for GCP Jobs

1. **Robustness**: Workers don't crash on individual errors, training continues
2. **Recovery**: Automatic checkpointing every 15 minutes prevents data loss
3. **Monitoring**: Memory and resource monitoring prevents system instability
4. **Debugging**: Detailed error logs with scenario context for issue resolution
5. **Efficiency**: Auto-resume from checkpoints reduces restart time
6. **Safety**: Graceful shutdown with emergency backups preserves progress

## Testing Results

- ✅ Successfully completed test runs with no KeyError exceptions
- ✅ Verified checkpointing creates and loads checkpoints correctly
- ✅ Confirmed 'fold' action and all actions are properly handled
- ✅ Validated error handling doesn't crash workers on iteration failures
- ✅ Memory monitoring and graceful shutdown working correctly

All changes maintain existing functionality while significantly improving robustness for long-running GCP jobs.
