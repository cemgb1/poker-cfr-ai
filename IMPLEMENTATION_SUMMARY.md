# Enhanced SequentialScenarioTrainer Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Implementation Complete - All Requirements Met

The enhanced `SequentialScenarioTrainer` has been successfully implemented with all requested features for multiple rollouts per visit and advanced stopping conditions.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Multiple Rollouts Per Visit**
- **Parameter**: `rollouts_per_visit` (int, default=1)
- **Functionality**: Each scenario iteration now performs configurable number of rollouts with different random contexts
- **Benefit**: Averaged returns provide more stable regret updates and better exploration

### 2. **Advanced Stopping Conditions**
- **Parameters**: 
  - `min_rollouts_before_convergence` (int, default=100)
  - `regret_stability_threshold` (float, default=0.05)
  - `stopping_condition_window` (int, default=20)
- **Functionality**: Enhanced convergence checking requires minimum rollouts AND regret stabilization
- **Benefit**: Prevents premature stopping and ensures sufficient training

### 3. **Comprehensive Rollout Statistics**
- **Tracking**: Rollout variance, payoff distribution, total rollouts per scenario
- **Logging**: Enhanced progress reports with rollout metrics and variance analysis
- **Export**: Detailed CSV reports include rollout statistics

### 4. **Full Backward Compatibility**
- **Default behavior**: `rollouts_per_visit=1` maintains original functionality
- **API compatibility**: All existing methods and parameters preserved
- **Drop-in replacement**: Can be used anywhere `EnhancedCFRTrainer` was used

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Backward Compatible)
```python
from enhanced_cfr_trainer_v2 import SequentialScenarioTrainer

# Traditional single rollout training (backward compatible)
trainer = SequentialScenarioTrainer(scenarios=scenarios)
results = trainer.run_sequential_training()
```

### Enhanced Multiple Rollouts
```python
# Advanced training with multiple rollouts per visit
trainer = SequentialScenarioTrainer(
    scenarios=scenarios,
    rollouts_per_visit=3,                    # 3 rollouts per scenario iteration
    iterations_per_scenario=1000,            # Max iterations per scenario
    stopping_condition_window=20,            # Convergence check window
    regret_stability_threshold=0.05,         # Regret stability threshold
    min_rollouts_before_convergence=100      # Min rollouts before early stopping
)

results = trainer.run_sequential_training()
```

### Configuration Options
```python
# Conservative training
trainer = SequentialScenarioTrainer(
    scenarios=scenarios,
    rollouts_per_visit=1,
    min_rollouts_before_convergence=50,
    regret_stability_threshold=0.1
)

# Aggressive training  
trainer = SequentialScenarioTrainer(
    scenarios=scenarios,
    rollouts_per_visit=5,
    min_rollouts_before_convergence=200,
    regret_stability_threshold=0.02
)
```

## 📊 Key Benefits

1. **Improved Training Stability**: Multiple rollouts per visit provide averaged returns, reducing variance in regret updates

2. **Better Exploration**: Each scenario iteration explores multiple random contexts (opponent betting, card distributions)

3. **Robust Convergence**: Minimum rollout requirements prevent premature stopping, ensuring adequate training

4. **Detailed Analytics**: Comprehensive rollout statistics enable deep training analysis

5. **Production Ready**: Full backward compatibility allows gradual adoption
