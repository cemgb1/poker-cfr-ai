# Unified Scenario Lookup Table Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a unified scenario lookup table (CSV) that aggregates all learned scenarios across all workers and updates at every logging interval, as requested in the problem statement.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Functionality
- **File**: `scenario_lookup_table.csv` in main output directory
- **Update Frequency**: Every logging interval (15 minutes for GCP trainer, configurable for Natural trainer)
- **Scope**: Single file shared by all workers (not per-worker)
- **Data Aggregation**: Combines data across all workers before writing

### 2. CSV Structure
The unified scenario lookup table contains the following columns:
- `scenario_key`: Unique identifier combining all scenario metrics
- `hand_category`: Type of poker hand (premium_pairs, medium_aces, etc.)
- `stack_category`: Stack depth category (ultra_short, short, medium, deep, very_deep)
- `blinds_level`: Blinds level (low, medium, high)
- `position`: Player position (BTN, BB)
- `opponent_action`: Current opponent context (mixed for aggregated data)
- `iterations_completed`: Number of training iterations completed for this scenario
- `total_rollouts`: Total rollouts performed (same as iterations for enhanced CFR)
- `regret`: Current average regret for this scenario
- `average_strategy`: Primary learned strategy (FOLD/CALL/RAISE group)
- `strategy_confidence`: Confidence percentage for the primary strategy
- `last_updated`: Timestamp of last update

### 3. Modified Files

#### `run_gcp_cfr_training.py`
- Added `export_unified_scenario_lookup_csv()` method
- Modified `log_training_progress()` to call CSV export at each interval
- Added call to `combine_worker_results()` before logging to ensure latest data
- Updated file cleanup to preserve `scenario_lookup_table.csv`

#### `enhanced_cfr_trainer_v2.py`
- Changed default tournament penalty from 0.6 to 0.2
- Updated documentation and initialization messages

#### `natural_game_cfr_trainer.py`
- Added `export_unified_scenario_lookup_csv()` method (same format as GCP trainer)
- Modified `log_training_progress()` to call CSV export
- Changed default tournament penalty from 0.6 to 0.2

#### `run_natural_cfr_training.py`
- Updated default tournament penalty parameter to 0.2

### 4. Key Features

#### Real-time Updates
- CSV is updated every 15 minutes during GCP training
- CSV is updated every log interval during Natural training
- Provides live monitoring of learning progress

#### Cross-worker Aggregation
- Combines regrets, strategies, and scenario counters from all workers
- Single unified view of learning state
- No per-worker files, just one shared lookup table

#### Tournament Penalty Default
- Changed from 0.6 to 0.2 across all trainers
- Encourages more moderate risk-taking as requested

#### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- Original CSV exports still work
- New functionality is additive

### 5. Testing

#### Test Suite: `test_unified_scenario_lookup.py`
- Tests tournament penalty default (0.2)
- Tests CSV structure and required columns  
- Tests CSV export with training data
- Tests logging interval integration
- All tests pass successfully

#### Demo Script: `demo_unified_scenario_lookup.py`
- Demonstrates real training with CSV updates
- Shows unified scenario tracking in action

### 6. Usage Examples

#### For GCP Training:
```python
trainer = GCPCFRTrainer(n_workers=4, log_interval_minutes=15)
trainer.run_parallel_training(total_iterations=200000)
# scenario_lookup_table.csv updated every 15 minutes
```

#### For Natural Training:
```python
trainer = NaturalGameCFRTrainer(tournament_survival_penalty=0.2)
trainer.train(n_games=10000, log_interval=100)
# scenario_lookup_table.csv updated every 100 games
```

#### Manual Export:
```python
trainer.export_unified_scenario_lookup_csv("my_scenario_table.csv")
```

### 7. Benefits

1. **Live Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into learning progress
2. **Scenario Coverage**: Track which scenarios are being learned
3. **Single Source of Truth**: One unified file instead of multiple per-worker files
4. **Consistent Format**: Same structure across GCP and Natural trainers
5. **Low Overhead**: Lightweight CSV updates don't impact training performance

### 8. File Locations
- Main output: `/scenario_lookup_table.csv`
- Preserved during cleanup in main directory
- Updated automatically during training
- Can be manually exported anytime

## Conclusion
The implementation fully satisfies all requirements from the problem statement:
✅ Unified scenario lookup table with all required columns
✅ Updates at every logging interval 
✅ Single file shared by all workers
✅ Aggregates data across workers before writing
✅ Named `scenario_lookup_table.csv` in main output directory
✅ Default tournament penalty set to 0.2
✅ Enables live monitoring of learning progress and scenario coverage
✅ Updated documentation and comments
